# Project Gravity (In Progress)

Project Gravity is a sci-fi 3D platformer game where precision is the key. The goal is to go from Launch Pad to Landing Pad without hitting any obstacles.

I had so much fun while developing the game. I changed the design of the player and also environment as the game development goes further. I was playing Metroid on my Nintendo Switch when I started developing this game. First, I inspired the spaceship by Metroid which was a horizontal ship. After thinking some thoughts about improving the movement of the Player (spaceship), I decided to change the spaceship's look and made it vertical. I like neon colors in general and love Synthwave's aesthetics so I took a lot of inspiration for the colors of the game's environment. 

I learned and experimented many new Unity terms:
* Onion Design when developing a game.
* Unity's Unit System.
* Advanced information about C# Class & Methods.
* Basic Input Binding for the movement.
* Using AddRelativeForce() for the Player's thrust system.
* Using Transform.Rotate() for rotating the Player.
* Further information about the rigidbody component.
* Using AudioSource SFX and using multiple audio clips in Unity.
* Using switch statements for tagging.
* Respawn the Player using SceneManager.
* Loading the next level.
* Using Invoke.
* Triggering particle effects.
* Adding cheat and debug keys for easier testing.
* Improved my knowledge about game design and level moments.
* Adding and manipulating lights.
* Using sin waves with Mathf.Sin() for oscillating obstacles.
* Quiting an application.
